I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [University of Bonn](https://www.bgse.uni-bonn.de/en).

My research interests lie at the intersection of Environmental Economics and Health Economics.
Specifically, I am interested in measuring weather impacts on health outcomes and behavior. I use big data and seek to bridge the Econometric Theory frontier with Environmental Economics.
